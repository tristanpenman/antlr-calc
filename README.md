# ANTLRcalc

## Overview

This repo shows how ANTLR v4 can be used to generate C++ code for a simple mathematical expression parser.

## Build

You'll need to install `antlr` and `antlr4-cpp-runtime` packages (e.g. from Homebrew).

A simple Makefile has been included, so you should just be able to run:

    make

This will build an executable called `calculator`.
